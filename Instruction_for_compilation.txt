Instruction for compilation:

In order to use the codes contained in the book with your main program (for example "mainprogram.f90"), after calling the required subroutine, you can directly link your main program with the source code (which is "all_in_one.f90") using the command in terminal 

gfortran mainprogram.f90 all_in_one.f90 -llapack

this will generate a file "a.out" and then execute this file using the command:

./a.out

this will give the desired output
